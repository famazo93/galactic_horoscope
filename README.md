# Galactic Horoscope Project Descriptions

## Codename: Hitchhikers' Guide to Astrology

>Â 
The Hitchhikers' Guide to Astrology has saved my relationship with my therapist several times over the years. I can't express how grateful I am.

### This Guide will help you find fortune, true love, or figure out what to have for dinner - no matter your life-form, number of tentacles or the exact planetary location.

There will be a simple user input interface written in HTML/CSS where the user shall provide some reference information about the most important factors that define their astrological aura (life-form, number of tentacles, galactical location, universal time, etc.).

The project will be augmented by JavaScript - creating a horoscope based on the user's input, animating input interface and creating a user flow.
